“If you’re interested, you come up with stories, excuses, reasons, and circumstances about why you can’t or why you won’t. If you’re committed, those go out the window. You just do whatever it takes.”
	— John Assaraf

## FINDING AND DEFINING YOUR WHY

Exercise Aim : discover and describe my Why? to be able to trigger it everyday, especially the deepest one.

Procedure
	0. Pull out the journal
	1. Think about "What it is that you are truly trying to
		pursue in life?".
		e.g. getting in shape, starting a biz., etc.
		call it G[i]
	2. What about G is important to you?
		write one or two points
		e.g. to have more energy, feel good
		call these what(s) E[i]

	> *sight: fear-setting; ? why(s) discovered in prev step
	  must align with personal principles
	
	3. Write "What about E is important to me?" and answer it
		-- basically repeat steps 2 & 3 till it makes sense
		-- at least 7 iterations
	
	> if you have more than 3 priorities, you have none

		are journaling

## 2 Optimal Environments for writing Journal

https://medium.com/the-mission/6-things-every-person-should-recover-from-daily-14271441b702#.54bezvm3d

	1. outside of your routine environment
		really step out of your routine env.
		once a week, 30-60 minute session
		where you at, sit rep, what challenges you are facing
		what you accomplished in this week WAS IT congruent
		if not, make corrections
		** 9.30
	
	> *sight: correct your course weekly, on review times,
	  like SpecOps do - self-feedback

	2. morning
		focus on output
				creativness
				solving problems which require creativity
				thinking outside the box ( prime @ prv. night )

## Reframing your Subconscious Mind

	1. That your subconscious is your CORE ASSUMPTIONS about yourself and the world around you
	2. Your life is a reflection of WHAT YOU BELIEVE YOU DESERVE... this is subconscious
	3. That in order to change your life, you need to retrain your subconscious
	4. This is best done JUST BEFORE YOU SLEEP and JUST AFTER YOU WAKE UP (hence, don't be on your smartphone at night, that will kill your meditative and creative potential)
	5. When you retrain your subconscious, your goals will happen very quickly

#### 10 minute before sleep

Take a few moments before you go to bed to meditate on and write down the things you’re trying to accomplish.

Ask yourself loads of questions related to that thing. In Edison’s words, make some “requests.” Write those questions and thoughts down on paper. 

Play with specificity, (more specific questions => the more clear will be your answers) While you’re sleeping, your subconscious mind will get to work on those things. 

#### 10 minute before sleep

it’s good to loosely direct your thought-dumping toward your goals. Consider the “requests” you made of your subconscious just before going to bed. You asked yourself loads of questions. You thought about and wrote down the things you’re trying to accomplish.

Now, first thing in the morning, start writing down whatever comes to mind about those things. I often get ideas for articles I’m going to write while doing these thought-dumps.

Theta state is an optimal mental state where radical behavior modification can occur, such as overcoming drug or alcohol addiction. Moreover, Theta is where super-learning can occur. As Dr. Joseph Murphy explains in, The Power of Your Subconscious Mind, “You avoid conflict between your conscious and subconscious in the sleepy state. Imagine the fulfillment of your desire over and over again prior to sleep. Sleep in peace and wake in joy.”

## Goal Setting

1. How to continually re-wire your subconscious.
    * high
    * specific
    * quantifiable

2. The importance of setting numeric goals and having specific dates associated with the achievement of those goals.

3. The psychology of "confidence," and that it is an effect or byproduct, not a cause. Confidence is the result of past performance.

#### Meaning of 100% commitment

Do or die.

“It takes a certain type of person to want to surf big waves, when the horizon goes black and a huge wall of water is bearing down on you, you have to want that wave in order to make it! If you hesitate or aren’t fully committed you are going to get eaten!”

In order to catch and ride a big wave, you must be 100 percent committed. If there is any hesitancy whatsoever, you will fail. You may even fail if you fully commit. But the only way you might succeed is if you’re dead set on seeing it to the end.

There’s a useful lesson from big wave surfing that applies to a number of contexts in our lives. When you’re fully committed, you have a different posture than if you’re only partially committed. When partially committed, you’re hesitant. You’re not confident. You’re unsure and undetermined. 

However, once you become dead set, all of the mental fog goes away. You become clear on what you’re doing and why you’re doing it. You stop thinking about the other options available to you. As Dr. Barry Schwartz has said in the book, The Paradox of Choice, “Knowing that you’ve made a choice that you will not reverse allows you to pour your energy into improving the relationship that you have rather than constantly second-guessing it.”

You need to be 100 percent committed if you want to successfully and quickly adapt to a new and challenging environment. The question is, how do you become 100 percent committed? That's the very question I studied throughout my doctoral research as an organizational psychologist. 

Specifically, I researched a concept I call, “The Point of No Return,” which is the moment it becomes easier to move toward your goals than to avoid them. Actually, your point of no return is the instant that pursuing your highest ambitions becomes your only option. You're fully committed to what you want to do, and this commitment creates a deep sense of confidence and congruence.

How does this work?

One of the most widely accepted theories explaining the relationship between biology and psychology is the biopsychological theory of personality proposed by Dr. Jeffrey Alan Gray in 1970. Gray proposed two systems governing all behaviors:

#### Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS): 

Your behavioral inhibition system is what attunes you to risks or threats in your environment. When you perceive these risks or threats, your behavioral inhibition system stops you from acting.

#### Behavioral Activation System (BAS): 

Your behavioral activation system, on the other hand, is what attunes you to rewards. When you perceive these rewards, your behavioral activation system encourages you to action so you can obtain the reward.

BIS and BAS are in constant tension, BIS dominates some parts of your life, BAS others. Most people have an avoidance-orientation toward life. They aren't acting according to their deepest desires. Instead, they're playing it safe. They're calculating their moves to ensure they don't look stupid.

It's good to be careful and have backup plans but daily actions should not be dictated by *avoidance mentality*.


## Don't Let Success Derail You

1. The fact that if you consistently practice these principles, you will becomes successful.

2. Once successful, your path will become more complex and confusing, not less.

3. Success, for most people, leads to plateau and failure.

4. If you want to continually succeed and evolve and grow, you must stick with these fundamentals.

Don't loose track of your why? Stick to the fundamentals
