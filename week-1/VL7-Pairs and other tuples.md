## Why?

For practical purposes we need to build all kinds of data structures, the very basic building blocks of which are tuples and lists. For sake of understanding upcoming literature, following rudimentary definitions 

Tuple:
  collection of n values, each can be of any type
List:
  collection of arbitary number of values each of identical type

## Pairs

IDK why this special case is discussed, but basically it's just a tuple with exactly 2 elements.
